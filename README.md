This is an MVC Web Application.
It uses a local SQL Server installation with Entity Framework.
The SQL files to create the 2 databases and insert data are included in this Repo.

To set this up locally:
Open and run the SQL to create the Employees Table and the Dependents Table.
From there you can add your own data or use the SQL files from this repo to insert some starting data.
